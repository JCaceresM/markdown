## Requeriments
Markdown Previewer:

Overview: Develop a Markdown previewer where users can input Markdown text
and instantly see the rendered HTML output.

Key Features:
 1. Markdown Input: Provide a text area where users can type or paste
Markdown content.
2. Live Preview: Display the HTML-rendered output in real-time as users type
or update the Markdown content.
3. Customization: Allow users to customize the editor with options such as
choosing a different theme or adjusting font size.
4. Export: Enable users to download the rendered HTML content as a file.
5. Syntax Highlighting: Implement syntax highlighting for the Markdown
input area to enhance readability.

Technologies:

- React for building the user interface.
- NextJS as React Framework.
- Markdown parser library (e.g., Marked.js) for converting Markdown to HTML.
- Optional: React libraries for customization (e.g., react-syntax-highlighter for
syntax highlighting).
